# static version of my full-website:

this is a static-version of my actual full-website as i cannot find a sustainable host for the server, so i'm gonna use static pages instead:

any personal info / credentials have been removed.

once i find a host, this repro will most likely be taken down, feel free to look through the code if you'd like.
