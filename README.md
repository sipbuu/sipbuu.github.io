# static version of my website


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> this version will likely stay up on github, but i plan on sticking to port forwarding via other providers.
> new projects i do daily tend to revolve around server back-side stuff, so this static-page is no longer reliable.

> [!NOTE]
> this page will be fully revamped as soon as i am not busy, so none of this is final;
> also once i find a server-host i can stick to, ~~this repro will be **deleted**~~

this is a static version of my website as i cannot find a sustainable host for the server, so i'm gonna use static pages instead:

any personal info / credentials have been removed.

feel free to look through the files and html if you'd like.
